# Open in Gitup README

This is a very simple extension that lets you open the  [Gitup](https://gitup.co/) from VS Code.

## Features

The extension runs the `gitup` command-line tool in the directory containing the current file.

Four commands are available:

<dl>
<dt>Open in GitUp (ctrl+alt+G)</dt>
<dd>Open GitUp in no particular view. The Map view is the default if the repository isn't already open.</dd>
<dt>
    Open in Gitup: Map View</br>
    Open in Gitup: Commit View</br>
    Open in Gitup: Stash View
</dt>
<dd>Open GitUp in the specified view.</dd>
</dl>


## Requirements

Install the `gitup` tool in your path. The easiest way is to use "Install Command Line Toolâ€¦" in the GitUp menu in the app.

See the [GitUp Wiki](https://github.com/git-up/GitUp/wiki/Using-GitUp-Command-Line-Tool) for instructions.
